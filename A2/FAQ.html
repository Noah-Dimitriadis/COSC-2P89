                        <li>Album Info/little description: I used Pitchforks review of each album and then used zerogpt's summarizer tool to write a summary of the albums review. I really hope this kind of use of AI is alright, I just didnt want to spend lots of time writing descriptions for everything</li>

                        <li>Faces - Tri Color Edition</li>
                        <li>So yes Faces is probably my favourite rap album of all time, I got the very nice and very fancy tri color edition for my birthday (Love You EM!) two years ago. It was a limited release put out by Mac Millers estate to celebrate the 10 year aniversary of the Faces mixtape along with its release to streaming services. It came with a couple posters and a very fancy tracklist/producer credits card which I will probably frame at some point (another thing on my todo list lol). </li>
